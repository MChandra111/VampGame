# VampGame
My first attempt at making a game on my own, programmed in C# in the Open-source game engine, "Godot".

## Motive
Learn game design principles, logic, and get experience with C#

## Progress
Basic mechanics complete
  - Movement (Double jumping, wall jumping dashing)
  - Physics (Stuff doesn't fly around)
  - Player movement feels fluid
  - Player can interact with things (pick stuff up, damage enemies, take damage, die, respawn)
  - UI shows health bar and a cooldown bar for the dash of the player
4 types of enemies complete
  - Slime (Jumps around horizontally)
  - Goblin (Stands around till player gets close and chases and stabs player)
  - Turret-Style (Shoots at player)
  - Big Goblin (Similar to small goblin but he's huge and hitboxes and mechanics are adjusted)
Map elements
  - Traps (Spike trap to deal damage to player)
  - Healing potion (Floating potion that heals the player
Demo level complete
